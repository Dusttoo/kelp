## Summary of what the project is and what it does
* Kelp is an app created for all of the citizens of Bikini Bottom to discover their favorite
(and worst) businesses in the area. It is a clone of Yelp. Non members of the site have the ability to
search for a business and view that businesses information and any questions or reviews related to that business.
A non member also has the ability to view all of the businesses and sort businesses by their category.
A logged in member has acces to all of the above functionality as well as the ability to post their own business, post a review for a business,
and ask a question about a business.

## Welcome to Kelp!

## Instructions on how to build/run the project (installation instructions)
* To start the app on your local machine you must first do an npm install on both the front and backend folders.
* You then need to create a user in psql matching the username provided in the .env-example folder
* Then you can migrate the database using ```npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate``` and seed
using ```npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate```

## List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
* This application uses express to host the backend server and sequelize to communicate with the database.
* On the frontend it uses React along with Redux.
* The Google Map API

## To-dos/future features
### In the future I would like to implement: 
* The ability for users to answer questions that have been posted
* An account page for users
* The ability to connect with other users via a friends list and feed
* The ability to search the map for businesses

## Road Blocks
This project was a ton of fun and I enjoyed having creative freedom to build something fun, yet ueseful. I did run into the occasional road block. The biggest being, learning the ins and outs of state. I had some struggles, primarily with the edit feature on reviews, with the page loading before the state had properly updated, and thus, an error was thrown. I was able to correct the issue by implementing a use effect on the business page that tracked the dispatch of the reviews on render.

## Search Feature

The search feature is something I am very proud of. It was fun to implement and seeing the final result makes me an incredibly happy developer. 
I implemented the feature by setting a state for the query to a new instance of the URLSearchParams, I then use that to compare it to the names of all of the businesses in the database. I was running into an issue with the casing of the names, but was able to bypass that by using a toLowerCase on both the query and the name.
