## Summary of what the project is and what it does
* Kelp is an app created for all of the citizens of Bikini Bottom to discover their favorite
(and worst) businesses in the area. It is a clone of Yelp. Non members of the site have the ability to
search for a business and view that businesses information and any questions or reviews related to that business.
A non member also has the ability to view all of the businesses and sort businesses by their category.
A logged in member has acces to all of the above functionality as well as the ability to post their own business, post a review for a business,
and ask a question about a business.

## Screenshots of your app in action (once completed)


## Instructions on how to build/run the project (installation instructions)
* To start the app on your local machine you must first do an npm install on both the front and backend folders.
* You then need to create a user in psql matching the username provided in the .env-example folder
* Then you can migrate the database using ```npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate``` and seed
using ```npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate```

## List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
* This application uses express to host the backend server and sequelize to communicate with the database.
* On the frontend it uses React along with Redux.
* The Google Map API

## To-dos/future features
### In the future I would like to implement: 
* The ability for users to answer questions that have been posted
* An account page for users
* The ability to connect with other users via a friends list and feed
* The ability to search the map for businesses
